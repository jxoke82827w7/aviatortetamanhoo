# 1Win Aviator: The Ultimate Guide to Playing the Crash Game in India

## What is 1Win Aviator?

1Win Aviator is a popular crash game developed by Spribe studio. The
game is based on a simple premise: you bet on how long an airplane will
fly before it crashes. The longer the plane flies, the higher your
potential winnings. However, if the plane crashes before you cash out,
you lose your bet.
